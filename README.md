## More details:

This project has tried to divide all the components into smaller and reusable components, and raw CSS has been used for its styling.
JavaScript codes are written based on React library. And the effort is to add Typescript to it in the future.
There is currently no test writing in the project, but soon the test will be added to the codes.
## The files are divided as follows:
 The file related to components includes the following components:
Contents, which itself has subsets for display and styling by using props.
Date, this component contains the day, month and year, which has both related styles and the React file inside it, and its styling changes based on the type of API it receives for both cards.
ReactionBar file, that contains styles and codes related to comments, likes and sharing.
The Data file contains the content and ReactionBar.
The Layout file is used for styling by using React components.
The Mock file is used to simulate the server.
UseContext is also used in the file store.
